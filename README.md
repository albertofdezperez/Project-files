This repository is created to upload the documentation that will be delivered.

All writing documents must be uploaded in **Word and PDF** with the following name: **MiiDrone_date_titleofthedocument**

It is also important to follow the **Word template** when writing any document and the **Power Point template** when making any presentation.

**Each area has its own branch**, so be careful where you upload the files. If the branch is not created, create it.

The **Master branch** will be used to upload the **final version of the documents**.
